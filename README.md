# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Projects

This repository contains the projects I completed as part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** on Coursera. The certificate program provided a comprehensive introduction to data science concepts, tools, and techniques, with hands-on experience in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

## Certificate Overview

The **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** covered the following key areas:
- **What is Data Science?**
- **Tools for Data Science**
- **Data Science Methodology**
- **Python for Data Science, AI & Development**
- **Python Project for Data Science**
- **Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python**
- **Data Analysis with Python**
- **Data Visualization with Python**
- **Machine Learning with Python**
- **Applied Data Science Capstone**

## Projects Included in This Repository

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis Project**: Performed data exploration and analysis on a real-world dataset using Python and Pandas.
2. **Data Visualization Project**: Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn, focusing on storytelling through data.
3. **Machine Learning Models**: Developed and evaluated machine learning models, including linear regression, classification, and clustering.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- **Python**: Core language used for all data science tasks, including data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.
- **Pandas and Numpy**: Used extensively for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Libraries for creating data visualizations and plots.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **SQL**: For querying and managing databases in the data analysis phase.
- **IBM Watson Studio**: A cloud-based platform used for performing data science tasks such as data wrangling, visualization, and machine learning in the capstone project.
